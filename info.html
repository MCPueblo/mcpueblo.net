							<h3>What is MCPueblo?</h3>
							<p>MCPueblo is a whitelisted 1.14.4 Minecraft server with a small dedicated community, that was released on the 17th of May of 2019. MCPueblo translated means "Minecraft Village". We pride ourselves on a vanilla experience, with only a few in-game tweaks to improve the game experience, such as one player sleep, online map, custom recipes, and more. Our server is community-focused, with monthly votes on new suggestions, and community builds such as spawn. We have zero ranks that affect the gameplay at all.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="features">
							<h3>What are our features?</h3>
							<p>Listed here are some of our best features that MCPueblo has to offer:</p>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Custom recipes</strong> - These include the ability to turn 2 slabs into one, a recipe for red sand that makes use of netherrack, and re-dyeable items/blocks. You can find the full list of recipes <a href="https://imgur.com/a/SW7ZazE" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
								<li><strong>Elytra drop</strong> - When you kill the ender dragon, an elytra is always dropped. This provides two alternative ways of obtaining elytras, whenever you prefer exploring the end ships or killing the ender dragon. Shulkers will also drop 2 shulker shells instead of one.</li>
								<li><strong>One player sleep</strong> - Only one member is required to sleep in the server, so there's no need to ask all the other members to sleep.</li>
								<li><strong><a href="http://map.mcpueblo.net" rel="nofollow">Online Map</a></strong> - Also known as Dynmap, this helpful map lets you see where players or bases are located, or where to live in the world.</li>
								<li><strong>Creative world</strong> - This world is made for the purpose of testing builds and redstone prototypes. It is a superflat world with creative mode. To get to the world simply type /creative, and to get back exactly where you came from type /back in the creative world.</li>
								<li><strong>/portalcalc</strong> - This command can calculate where to place your nether portals in both the overworld and the nether using coordinates. It should be always used when making portals in the nether to avoid conflict with other portals.</li>
								<li><strong>DiscordSRV</strong> - This feature lets you chat to or from MCPueblo's Discord server, so you never miss out on anything that may happen only in-game.</li>
								<li><strong>/home &amp; /spawn</strong> - These commands are here for your convenience. You can have up to 3 homes.</li>
								<li><strong>Instant leaf decay</strong> - When all logs inside a tree has been chopped down, all the surrounding leaves will break instantly, meaning no more waiting for it to decay.</li>
								<li><strong>Building Challenges</strong> - MCPueblo does weekly building challenges of a wide variety of themes and topics. One must post in the corresponding post their entry, and the winner will get an extra home and a small prize in-game prize sent to them.</li>
							</ol>

						</div>
						<div id="rules">
							<h3>What are our rules?</h3>
							<p>These are the server rules which you have to follow, else you may get banned. All rules have a 3-strike system, meaning that if you break any rule 3 times, you will be banned from MCPueblo. We reserve the right to unwhitelist or ban anybody who doesn't meet our standards for a MCPueblo member.</p>
							<ol>
								<li><strong>Be mature</strong> - Maturity is key to become a good member of MCPueblo. Please do not troll people, don't talk about sensitive topics like politics or drugs, and avoid excessive swearing. Inmature arguments, attitudes or behavior will not be tolerated at all.</li>
								<li><strong>No spamming or advertising</strong> - Advertising another server than isn't MCPueblo will get you banned. Don't spam colored chat or repetitive content, as we want a clean chat.</li>
								<li><strong>Stay active</strong> - We ask members to remain active in MCPueblo at least a few times per week. If it has been a week since the last time you've been online in the server, you will be contacted to explain your inactivity. If there's no reply after another week, you will be kicked and unwhitelisted from the server. Members can rejoin at any time with the Discord link below if they wish to return.</li>
								<li><strong>Do not grief or steal</strong> - Nobody should have their home ruined, just somebody blew your house up and stole your belongings. Don't grief or steal anything, not even as a joke. Griefing and stealing is pointless, as we have plugins to track every item taken and every block broken/placed by any player.</li>
								<li><strong>No cheating or hacking</strong> - We do not permit the use of mods and clients designed for cheating, such as X-Ray, aimbot, unauthorized flying, etc. Basic mods such as Optifine, minimaps, inventory organizers are allowed. In case you're not sure if the mod is permitted, ask a staff member for information.</li>
								<li><strong>Respect nature</strong> - We like clean things, so why should you trash the natural environment? Don't leave the canopy of trees up, don't do a poor job of flattening land, don't leave one block towers, and repair creeper holes if you get blown up by one.</li>

								<li><p><strong>JuanDelPueblo</strong> - I am the founder and owner of MCPueblo. My goal is to host a thriving server while also helping players in the server. While I'm still a student at a vocational school, I am working my way towards becoming a computer technician. Other than Minecraft, I also play a wide variety of Nintendo games from every kind of console, with my favorite games being Legend of Zelda and Smash Bros (I main Pichu and Wolf).</p></li>
								<li><p><strong>NinjaMagic1000</strong> -  I am an admin for MCPueblo. I am an active player and administrator for this server with the goal of contributing to a mature and respectful atmosphere. I am an excelling high school student, ice hockey player, and golfer from Canada with an interest in Entrepreneurship and Computer Science. Although my life is busy, I am committed to MCPueblo. In the past, I've played other games such as NHL and Fortnite -- however, I always seem to return to my gaming roots of playing Minecraft.</p></li>
								<li><p><strong>CoyoteWolf</strong> - I am a moderator for MCPueblo. I found MCPueblo not too long after it first came onto Reddit, and since have enjoyed being a part of it. Once you get to know me, I can be pretty chill, and I like helping others. When you can't find me on MCPueblo, i'm often on the town trail riding my bike, and enjoying the outdoors.</p></li>
								<li><p><strong>aStoneHoe</strong> - I am a moderator for MCPueblo. I spend a lot of time playing League of Legends and Minecraft, but my ability to build is much better than my ELO so I am happy to chill on the server and help out wherever possible.</p></li>
								<li><p><strong>Bragus</strong> -  I am a moderator for MCPueblo. I have been playing Minecraft since early beta, and I'm lucky enough to have found this great little community. Outside of Minecraft, I really enjoy playing other sandbox games such as Factorio or Terraria, and I'm also big into single player RPGs.</p></li>
